##### CTF #1

- flag - INTRO_TO_CYBERSECURITY{W3_@TT4CK_4T_D@WN}

Give this as a starter hint on the task: Alright special agent P0C0, we've just intercepted a message from enemy, but the message has been **encoded** your task is to use this tool [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to crack their **cipher!**

- ciphertext - 2e 2d 2d 20 2e 2e 2e 2d 2d 20 2e 2e 2d 2d 2e 2d 20 2e 2d 2d 2e 2d 2e 20 2d 20 2d 20 2e 2e 2e 2e 2d 20 2d 2e 2d 2e 20 2d 2e 2d 20 2e 2e 2d 2d 2e 2d 20 2e 2e 2e 2e 2d 20 2d 20 2e 2e 2d 2d 2e 2d 20 2d 2e 2e 20 2e 2d 2d 2e 2d 2e 20 2e 2d 2d 20 2d 2e

Hints for Mentor's to give:
- Show them the variety of encoding and decoding methods
- Try to point out why the decoding might not be working (when they decode from base64) without giving away the caeser's cipher shift of it.

##### CTF #2

Give this as a starter hint on the task: Shoot! Looks like the enemy has figured out plans and has switched to a totally different encryption method.

- flag - INTRO_TO_CYBERSECURITY{BIT-TACULOUS}
- ciphertext - BE_YDT_DTHRINYXNH^YB_RpIB_&_JH^GD^Xv

Hints for Mentors to give:
- What is an alternative way to represent letters in ones and zeros? (maybe give this one after first trying to first point out that frequency analysis doesn't work here)
- What's the a popular bitwise operation used in a lot of cryptography? (XOR, try to hint this in ohter ways if you can)
